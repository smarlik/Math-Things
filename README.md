This is a math book covering many different math topics which I learned over the years.

This book is written using Libre Office so to open the book you can use Libre Office (maybe Microsoft Word could work)

Unfortunately Git Hub does not support Libre Office and does not show changes between the commits easily.
Since the book is written in Libre Office format, changes between commits can be easily viewed using Libre Office. 
For example, to compare the current version of the book with commit A, first download the version from commit A. 
Then, open the current version in Libre Office, go to Edit > Track Changes > Compare Document, and select the version from commit A. 😁
